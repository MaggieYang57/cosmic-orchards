## Running the Program
No installation necessary. In order to run the .exe file, these items should already be in the folder:
- Cosmic Orchards_Data
- baselib.dll
- Cosmic Orchards.exe
- GameAssembly.dll
- UnityCrashHandler64.exe
- UnityPlayer.dll

## Desktop Version
No additional hardware is necessary to play the desktop version. A mouse is recommended to move the camera, but it is playable with only a keyboard and trackpad as well.

## VR Version
This experience has only been tested with the Meta Quest 2 headset, therefore the same performance quality cannot be guaranteed with other headsets. To play the VR version, please ensure that the headset is properly connected to your device before opening the program.
